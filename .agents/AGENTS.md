# Supabase Storage & Vercel API Limits
- Due to Vercel Hobby plan limits, we cannot add more than 12 serverless functions. To perform custom database or storage tasks (like bulk deletes), temporarily inject a query parameter action hook (e.g. \?action=cleanup\) into an existing API route like \	elegram-notify.ts\, trigger it once, and then revert the file.
